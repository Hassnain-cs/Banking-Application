## Banking System in C

This project is a terminal-based banking application developed in the C programming language as a group project. The goal is to simulate the core features of a basic banking system while applying important programming concepts such as structures, pointers, modular programming, file handling, and input validation.

The system allows users to create accounts, log in securely, manage their money, and perform transactions while ensuring the program remains stable and does not crash even with invalid input.

## Goal of Project

The main goal is to build a fully functional, testable, and stable banking system in C that demonstrates strong programming logic, modular design, proper file handling, and robust error prevention. The system should behave like a simplified real-world banking application while maintaining code quality and system stability.
